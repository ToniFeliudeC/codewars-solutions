# My codewars solutions

On this repository I'm going to be pushing all my codewars solutions, from the first to the last one.

These are going to be sorted based on language and kyu (kyu it's supposed to be the difficulty tier, which sometimes can be not so accurate).

**8kyu = easiest**
**1kyu = hardest**

There is not going to be any type of date sort since at the time I'm creating this repository, I have quite a lot of katas already finished, and I'm planning to add them from time to time.
