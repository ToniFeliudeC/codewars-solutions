# My codewars solutions

On this repository I'm going to be pushing all my codewars solutions.

These are going to be sorted based on language and kyu (kyu it's supposed to be the difficulty tier, which sometimes can be not so accurate).

**8kyu = easiest**

**1kyu = hardest**

There is not going to be any type of date sort since at the time I'm creating this repository, I have quite a lot of katas already finished, and I'm planning to add them from time to time.

#### Commentaries

I'm going to try my best commenting my already done and upcoming katas, so that anyone, but mainly my future self, will be able to know what the actual **** am I trying to do.

Sometimes, if the code is very simple or I think that the variables' names make it really self-explanatory, I won't be commenting it.

#### My current codewars kyu and honor
